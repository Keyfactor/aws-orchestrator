## Overview

AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected resources. SSL/TLS certificates are used to secure network communications and establish the identity of websites over the Internet as well as resources on private networks. AWS Certificate Manager removes the time-consuming manual process of purchasing, uploading, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates.  The orchestrator supports Okta OAth authentication, as well as AWS IAM accounts. The Okta Support allows authentication against a 3rd party identity provider in AWS.  From there you can get temporary credentials for a role that you setup in each AWS Account.

This integration also supports the reading of existing certificate ACM key/value pair tags during inventory and adding these tags when adding new certificates.  Modifying and adding ACM tags during certificate renewal, however, is NOT supported.  This is due to the fact that the AWS API does not allow for ACM tag modification when updating a certificate in one step.  This would need to be done in multiple steps, leading to the possibility of the certificate being left in an error state if any intermediate step were to fail.  However, while the modification/addition of ACM tags is not supported, all existing ACM tags WILL remain in place during renewal.

## Compatibility

This integration is compatible with Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator version 10.1 and later.

## Support
The AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Universal Orchestrator extension If you have a support issue, please open a support ticket by either contacting your Keyfactor representative or via the Keyfactor Support Portal at https://support.keyfactor.com. 
 
> To report a problem or suggest a new feature, use the **[Issues](../../issues)** tab. If you want to contribute actual bug fixes or proposed enhancements, use the **[Pull requests](../../pulls)** tab.

## Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Universal Orchestrator extension, we recommend that you install [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil). Kfutil is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating store types, installing extensions, and instantiating certificate stores in Keyfactor Command.


### Setting up AWS Authentication

Depending on your choice of authentication providers, choose the appropriate section:
<details>
<summary>AWS Certificate Manager <code>AWS-ACM</code></summary>

### AWS Setup
Options for authenticating:
1. Okta or other OAuth configuration (refer to `AwsCerManO` below)
2. IAM User Auth configuration (refer to `AwsCerManA` below)
3. EC2 Role Auth or other default method supported by the [AWS SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/creds-assign.html)

As one option for #3, to set up Role Auth for an EC2 instance, follow the steps below. Note, this applies specifically __when the orchestrator is running `ACM-AWS` inside of an EC2 instance__. When the option to assume an EC2 role is selected, the Account ID and Role will be assumed using the default credentials supplied in the EC2 instance via the AWS SDK.
1. Assign or note the existing IAM Role assigned to the EC2 instance running
2. Make sure that role has access to ACM
3. When configuring the `AWS-ACM` store, do not select either IAM or OAuth methods in the store's settings. This will make it use the AWS SDK to lookup EC2 credentials.

</details>

<details>
<summary>[Deprecated] AWS Certificate Manager with Okta Auth Configuration <code>AwsCerManO</code></summary>

### AWS Setup
1. A 3rd party [identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) similar to [this](docsource/images/AWSIdentityProvider.gif) needs to be setup in AWS for each account.
2. An Aws [Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) similar to [this](docsource/images/AWSRole1.gif) needs Added for each AWS account.
3. Ensure the [trust relationship](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/edit_trust.html) is setup for that role.  Should  look like [this](docsource/images/AWSRole2.gif).

### OKTA Setup
1. Ensure your Authorization Server Is Setup in OKTA.  Here is a [sample](docsource/images/OktaSampleAuthorizationServer.gif).
2. Ensure the appropriate scopes are setup in Okta.  Here is a [sample](docsource/images/OktaSampleAuthorizationServer-scopes.gif).
3. Setup an Okta App with similar settings to [this](docsource/images/OktaApp1.gif) and [this](docsource/images/OktaApp2.gif).

</details>

<details>
<summary>[Deprecated] AWS Certificate Manager with IAM Auth Configuration <code>AwsCerManA</code></summary>

### AWS Setup
1. An Aws [Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) Needs Added for the permissions you want to grant, see [sample](docsource/images/AWSRole1.gif).
2. A [Trust Relationship](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/edit_trust.html) is setup for that role.  Should look like something like [this](docsource/images/AssumeRoleTrust.gif).
3. AWS does not support programmatic access for AWS SSO accounts. The account used here must be a [standard AWS IAM User](docsource/images/UserAccount.gif) with an Access Key credential type.

| Discovery    | ðŸ”² Unchecked  |
| Reenrollment | ðŸ”² Unchecked |
| Create       | ðŸ”² Unchecked     |

### Creation Using kfutil:
`kfutil` is a custom CLI for the Keyfactor Command API and can be used to created certificate store types.
For more information on [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil) check out the [docs](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart)

#### Using online definition from GitHub:
This will reach out to GitHub and pull the latest store-type definition
```shell
# AWS Certificate Manager v3
kfutil store-types create AWS-ACM-v3
```

#### Offline creation using integration-manifest file:
If required, it is possible to create store types from the [integration-manifest.json](./integration-manifest.json) included in this repo.
You would first download the [integration-manifest.json](./integration-manifest.json) and then run the following command
in your offline environment.
```shell
kfutil store-types create --from-file integration-manifest.json
```

### Manual Creation
If you do not wish to use the `kfutil` CLI then certificate store types can be creating in the web UI as described below.

* **Create AWS-ACM-v3 manually in the Command UI**:
    <details><summary>Create AWS-ACM-v3 manually in the Command UI</summary>

    Create a store type called `AWS-ACM-v3` with the attributes in the tables below:

    #### Basic Tab
    | Attribute | Value | Description |
    | --------- | ----- | ----- |
    | Name | AWS Certificate Manager v3 | Display name for the store type (may be customized) |
    | Short Name | AWS-ACM-v3 | Short display name for the store type |
    | Capability | AWS-ACM-v3 | Store type name orchestrator will register with. Check the box to allow entry of value |

    Unzip the archive containing extension assemblies to a known location.

    > **Note** If you don't see an asset with a corresponding .NET version, you should always assume that it was compiled for `net6.0`.

2. **Locate the Universal Orchestrator extensions directory.**

    * **Default on Windows** - `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Orchestrator\extensions`
    * **Default on Linux** - `/opt/keyfactor/orchestrator/extensions`
    
3. **Create a new directory for the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Universal Orchestrator extension inside the extensions directory.**
        
    Create a new directory called `aws-orchestrator`.
    > The directory name does not need to match any names used elsewhere; it just has to be unique within the extensions directory.

4. **Copy the contents of the downloaded and unzipped assemblies from __step 2__ to the `aws-orchestrator` directory.**

5. **Restart the Universal Orchestrator service.**

    Refer to [Starting/Restarting the Universal Orchestrator service](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/StarttheService.htm).


6. **(optional) PAM Integration** 

    The AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Universal Orchestrator extension is compatible with all supported Keyfactor PAM extensions to resolve PAM-eligible secrets. PAM extensions running on Universal Orchestrators enable secure retrieval of secrets from a connected PAM provider.

    To configure a PAM provider, [reference the Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam) to select an extension, and follow the associated instructions to install it on the Universal Orchestrator (remote).
